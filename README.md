# Tennis Outcome Prediction

This repository contains the code and data for my M.Sc. thesis titled **Predicting Tennis Match Outcome: A Machine Learning Approach Using the SRP-CRISP-DM Framework**. It aims to provide a structured, methodical approach to predictive analytics in tennis, using machine learning and data mining techniques.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toyanunal/Tennis-Outcome-Prediction-Thesis.git
cd Tennis-Outcome-Prediction-Thesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Overview

The repository is structured into Jupyter Notebooks that sequentially take you through the stages of the predictive modeling process:

_0_dataset_creation.ipynb: Constructs the dataset using two data sources.
_1_dataset_analysis.ipynb: Analyses the dataset for initial insights.

_2_target_transformation.ipynb: Transforms the target variable for modeling.

_3_betting_odds.ipynb: Examines and processes betting odds data.

_4_missing_data_handling.ipynb: Handles missing data to maintain model integrity.

_5_feature_extraction.ipynb: Extracts features for use in predictive models.

_6_data_preparation.ipynb: Prepares data for model training and evaluation.

_6_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb: Conducts exploratory data analysis to inform the modeling.

Each notebook is documented with code, comments, and visualizations to explain the process.
